Laurel Hell is a soundtrack for transformation 
where vulnerability and resilience, sorrow and 
delight, error and transcendence can all be seen
as human, worthy of acknowledgment, and ultimately, 
love. It cements Mitski as an artist who possesses
the power of turning our most savage and alienated 
experiences into the very elixir that cures them.

Mitski’s longest ever writing process concluded amid
a radically changed world. She recorded Laurel Hell
with her longtime producer Patrick Hyland throughout
the pandemic, during which some of the songs “slowly
took on new forms and meanings, like seed to flower.”
The tension that emerges between her refined but
plaintive lyrics and the effervescent 1980s sound is
a desperately needed infusion. It’s the work of a mature
artist that delivers nuanced profundity on a current of
contagious dance beats.
